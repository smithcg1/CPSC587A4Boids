You can change the number of geese and the ranges they interact with each 
other using the "parameters.txt" file inside the "models" folder.

For each line enter the desired number directly after the colon
    - numberOfBoids changes the number of geese that spawn.
        (integers only, between 0 and 500)

    - ra sets the range of avoidance, the range geese will try to move away from each other
        (anything greater than 0)

    - rc sets the range of cohesion, the range geese will alignment with each other
        (anything greater than ra)

    - rg sets the range of gathering, the range geese will see others and try to approach
        (anything greater than rc)

    - rMax sets the range at which boids will start to turn around
        (anything greater than rg)



Additionally, a lure can be spawned to lead the geese to a specific area.
The controlls for the lure respectively are:
    - M     : Turn lure On/Off
    - ./,   : Increase/decrease lure strength
    - J/L   : Move lure left/right
    - I/K   : Move lure forward/backwards
    - O/U   : Move lure up/down

(refrences to directions are based on initial camera position)




The system has a minor computational acceleration applied compared to n^2 that should have shifted boid calculations from n^2 to n*lgn but only resulted in an increase in number of boids that animate smoothly from 400 to 500 (%25 increase). Attempts to implement the full acceleration using a grid system were unsuccessfull.
